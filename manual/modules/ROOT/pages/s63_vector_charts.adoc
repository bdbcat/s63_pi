Charts Plugin Released] +

=== Goal

This Plugin supports use of S63 encrypted Charts and dramatically
expands OpenCPN's range of charts available. +
These charts are quite reasonably priced….S-63 is the encrypted
distribution format for S-57 vector charts. Today, hydrographical
offices all over the world are producing their official vector charts in
the S-57 format. Distribution is done under the S-63 standard. +
 +
To use the encrypted charts, you must get a license for your particular
machine (called Permit), make sure to visit

*_http://o-charts.org/_*

for more information and to get the permits. +
 +
S63 is an encrypted version of S57 vector charts, and is the standard
format for almost all, officially published, vector charts in today’s
world. As a matter of fact, only NOAA and the East Asia Hydrographic
Commission (EAHC), publishes free unencrypted S57 charts nowadays. +
 +
These, S57 and S63 charts, are the current state of the art charts. The
quality of the charts are the best vector charts available. They are
always kept up to date. No other vector chart are in the same league. +
There are, however also some drawbacks. Many popular cruising areas are
very poorly covered as the focus is on the needs for commercial
shipping. One example is he Bahamas area. Another problem is the
relatively high price. When licensing consider the licensing period.
Your charts will be available still after expiring just without weekly
updates. +
 +
OpenCPN handles these commercial, non free, charts through an open
source plugin, that in the background connects to a “black box” helper
application. An external entity, *_http://o-charts.org_*, handles the
encrypted and commercial aspects of the S-63 plug-ins for OpenCPN. +

=== Get Started

* Download the plugin for your operating system the official OpenCPN
download page.
* Also download and read the informative Documentation from
*_http://o-charts.org/downloads.html_*. Really!!
* Install the plugin the way you normally install programs on your
operating system. The S-63 plug-in gets enabled at installation.
* Check that your Options→Charts shows a new “S63 Charts” tab, as in the
pictures below.
* At the S-63 Keys/Permit tab you can create a _system identifier file_
which “fingerprints” your individual system - a file you will need for
the InstallPermit. Try this on your system before licensing charts to
ensure that a fingerprint can be created for you.
* Now go to the O-charts shop to get your “User Permit” and “Install
Permit”. Use these to license your chart selection.
* Detailed instructions are available on
*_http://o-charts.org[o-charts.org]_*
